# AirBC

AirBC is a web app that models a real-life airline company page. It allows public to view Airport, Flight, Ticket, and Route information, customers to log in and book tickets, and staff to manage database and view summary data reports.

Project planning is in `project-proposal`, `project-schema` and `project-spec`. All the code resides in `project-final`.
